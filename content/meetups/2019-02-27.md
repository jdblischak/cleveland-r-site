title: 'Facilitating Reproducible Academic Manuscript Development: The ''projects''
  Pkg'
description: 'The `projects` R package introduces a dedicated workflow for academic
  research manuscripts, assisting researchers in their efficiency and organization
  in manuscript development. It supplies an intuitive file structure for storing raw
  and cleaned study data sets, and it provides customizable R Markdown templates for
  data analysis and manuscript development. Considering the growing emphasis that
  the contemporary scientific community places on reproducibility, the `projects`
  R package was created in the interest of facilitating reproducible research, particularly
  for team science. Nik Krieger was born and raised in North Royalton, Ohio. He obtained
  a Master of Science in Biostatistics from Case Western Reserve University last year
  and began work as an R-focused data scientist at the Cleveland Clinic upon graduation.
  He is on the Northeast Ohio Cohort for Atherosclerotic Risk Estimation (NEOCARE)
  investigative team, led by Drs. Jarrod Dalton and Adam Perzynski, which focuses
  on the impact of social determinants of health on the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular
  disease. '

title: Temporal Change in the Power Production of Real-world Photovoltaic Systems...
description: "Yang Hu:\_Temporal Change in the Power Production of Real-world Photovoltaic
  Systems Under Diverse Climatic Conditions This research focus on using machine learning
  algorithm, a series of regression model in particular, quantitatively evaluate more
  than one thousand PV systems temporal power output change across different climate
  zones and different PV modules technology and manufactures. These PV systems are
  part of the CWRU SDLE Research Center's global sunfarm network (GSFN), which has
  developed to include 787 PV power plants and outdoor test facilities. The analysis
  of this large PV data set was driven by a non-relational data warehouse for multiple
  heterogeneous energy data, referred to as Energy-CRADLE. Through the statistical
  models we rank ordered the external variables that impact the PV system\u2019s temporal
  performance change, these variables are : Koppen-Geiger climatic zones , PV module
  manufacturer, system age (in months), and the mounting method (roof, ground, and
  canopy) of the system.\_ About Yang Hu:\_ Yang Hu majored in Materials Sicence and
  Engineering, at CASE. He is graduating in January with a Ph.D. degree. He has been
  working with Prof. Roger French at Solar Durability and Lifetime Extension (SDLE)
  Research Center in the last 5 years. Find him on\_Google Scholar page, and the\_SDLE
  Research Center.\_ "

title: Advancements in Deep Learning Privacy and Encryption with Jason Mancuso
description: 'In the future, our most impactful applications will rely on our most
  sensitive data such as medical records, financial statements, location history,
  and voice transcripts. If this data were to end up in the wrong hands it could be
  disastrous to the individual, erode trust in the company, and lead to legal implications
  with the rise of policies such as GDPR. However, with recent advances in computing
  power and cryptographic techniques data privacy and machine learning no longer need
  to be adversaries. In this talk, we introduce the importance of data privacy for
  advancing machine learning applications across healthcare, finance, and transportation.
  We discuss the many different technologies enabling this future such as differential
  privacy, secure multi-party computation, garbled circuits, and how they can be used
  to train and deploy secure, privacy-preserving machine learning models. Finally,
  we demonstrate how you can use these technologies today using tf-encrypted (https://github.com/mortendahl/tf-encrypted),
  an open source library built on-top of TensorFlow for secure, privacy-preserving
  machine learning. Jason is a research scientist at Dropout Labs, the founder of
  the Cleveland AI Group, and a member of the AI Village at DEFCON and OpenMined communities.
  He works on novel methods making machine learning more performant for privacy-preserving
  techniques like secure computation and differential privacy, most notably by contributing
  to the tf-encrypted project. He has worked on a variety of safety and security problems,
  including safe reinforcement learning, secure and verifiable agent auditing, and
  adversarial machine learning. His contributions to the OpenMined project formed
  the foundation of the current version of PySyft, a generic platform for privacy-preserving
  machine learning. His previous work with the Cleveland Clinic established a state-of-the-art
  in blood test classification and demonstrated that machine learning can virtually
  eliminate the problem of medical malpractice due to contaminated blood samples.
  He graduated from John Carroll University with a B.Sc. in Mathematics. '

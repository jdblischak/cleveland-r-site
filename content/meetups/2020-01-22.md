title: Survival analysis, Salesforce, Shiny, and Shinyproxy by Bryan Lewis
description: 'A sales and marketing pipeline model tries to predict sales from a time
  series of observations associated with given accounts. The observations may have
  many features, importantly including labels of reasonably well-defined *stages*
  of the sales process. Salesforce conveniently exports such observations in easy
  to analyze form. Viewed through the right kind of lens, models like this look a
  bit like classical survival models. I''ll talk a little about some models along
  these lines that I''ve been working on together with a friend. In order to make
  the models easy to use, we designed a shiny app. In order to make the app available
  to our clients, at least in beta form, we deployed it with Shinyproxy (and also
  Docker and Nginx), a tool that makes deploying Shiny apps pretty easy to do. I''ll
  discuss this delightful deployment process. About Bryan:Bryan often thinks about
  mathematical approaches to simplifying the computation of large-scale problems.
  He''s the coauthor with Taylor Arnold and Mike Kane of the new CRC Press textbook,
  "A Computational Approach to Statistical Learning." His R packages include threejs
  and irlba, and he played a small role in the introduction of shiny. '

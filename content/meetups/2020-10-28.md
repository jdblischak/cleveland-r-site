title: 'Yixuan Qiu: Prettier R Graphs and Documents with {showtext}+{prettydoc}'
description: 'Prettier R Graphs and Documents with {showtext}+{prettydoc} Description:
  In this talk I will introduce two R packages that aim at making your plots and R
  Markdown documents prettier. First, the {showtext} package makes it easy to use
  your favorite fonts in R plots with virtually any graphics device. The function
  interface is device-independent, and fonts can either come from a local machine
  or from an online repository such as Google Fonts. In the second part, I will introduce
  the {prettydoc} package that provides a number of alternative themes for R Markdown
  documents. They are designed to be good-looking yet small in size. There are also
  some unique features of {prettydoc} such as code highlighting options and offline
  math expressions. At the end of the talk, I will mention how to extend the two packages
  to fit your own need, for example creating a font package, or adding a new theme
  for {prettydoc}. Bio: Yixuan Qiu is an assistant professor in the School of Statistics
  and Management at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE). His research
  interests include statistical computing, deep learning models, and data visualization.
  Yixuan is an active software developer in the R community, and has authored and
  maintained many popular packages including RSpectra, RcppNumerical, recosystem,
  showtext, and prettydoc. Before joining SUFE, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher
  in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University.
  He obtained his PhD in statistics from Purdue University in 2018. Note: this talk
  will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel. '

title: Building Shiny Apps Workshop
description: "We're going to try a hands-on meeting. Bryan Lewis will walk the group
  through creating a shiny application.\_ Please: \u2022 Bring a laptop if you have
  one available \u2022 Install a recent version of R \u2022 Install the shiny package
  To install shiny, at an R prompt run: install.packages(\"shiny\")  I would recommend
  you install RStudio as well, but this is optional. We should have internet access
  available, but it will make everyone's time more productive if all of the pre-requisites
  are out of the way. If you have any problems with the installs, feel free to message
  me (Tim Hoolihan) through contact the organizer button on this site. Beginner's
  in R are welcome and encouraged to come. We may pair folks with a more experienced
  developer as needed, but please don't feel intimidated if you are new to R. "

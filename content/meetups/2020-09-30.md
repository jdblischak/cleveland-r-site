title: 'Emily Zabor: Creating presentation-ready summary tables with {gtsummary}'
description: 'Creating presentation-ready summary tables with the {gtsummary} package
  in R Presenting the results of summary statistics and regression models in a reproducible
  fashion is an essential task for many data analysts. However, the tools for creating
  well-formatted tables in R have been either limited in scope or cumbersome to use.
  The {gtsummary} package was written to work with the {gt} package from RStudio to
  create presentation-quality tables using sensible defaults but with high customizability,
  helping reduce the need for post-hoc table formatting. This talk will introduce
  users to the {gtsummary} package, from the basic functions for summary tables to
  details of customization options. Emily is a biostatistician at Cleveland Clinic
  in the Department of Quantitative Health Sciences and The Taussig Cancer Institute
  where she collaborates with oncologists on applied clinical research and does methodologic
  research on statistical methods for clinical trial design and survival analysis.
  Before joining the Cleveland Clinic, Emily worked as a research biostatistician
  at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and was a founding board
  member of the R-Ladies NYC chapter. Emily earned her MS is biostatistics from the
  University of Minnesota in 2010 and her DrPH in biostatistics from Columbia University
  in 2019. Note: this talk will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel. '

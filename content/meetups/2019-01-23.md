title: 'It depends: A dialog about dependencies by Jim Hester'
description: 'It depends (Jim''s talk) Software dependencies can often be a double
  edged sword. On one hand they let you take advantage of others'' work, giving your
  software marvelous new features and reducing bugs. On the other hand they can change,
  causing your software to break unexpectedly and increasing your maintenance burden.
  These problems occur everywhere, in R scripts, R packages, Shiny applications and
  deployed ML pipelines. So when should you take a dependency and when should you
  avoid them? Well, it depends! This talk will show ways to weigh the pros and cons
  of a given dependency and provide tools for calculating the weights for your project.
  It will also provide strategies for dealing with dependency changes, and if needed,
  removing them. We will demonstrate these techniques with some real life cases from
  packages in the tidyverse and r-lib. vctrs &amp; type-stability (Hadley''s talk)
  vctrs is a new package that provides tools (cognitive and computational) to ensure
  that functions behave consistently with respect to inputs of varying length and
  type. The end goal of vctrs is to be invisible to the end user of the tidyverse
  (simply enabling their predictions about function outputs to be more correct), but
  will help developers write functions that "just work". '

title: 'Dec. Meeting: Database Best Practices &amp; Poisson Talk'
description: "Talk 1: \_Jim Hester:\_Database Best Practices Getting data into and
  out of databases is one of the most fundamental parts of\_data science. Much of
  the world's data is stored in databases of various forms,\_including traditional
  databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server and\_Oracle, as well as NoSQL databases
  like BigQuery, Redshift and Spark. Modern methods using the odbc, pool and DBI packages
  make connecting,\_querying and retrieval from these diverse data sources concise,
  uniform and\_performant. Odbc provides a DBI interface to ODBC drivers, allowing
  fast\_access to a wide variety of ODBC compatible databases. Pool provides a\_fault-tolerant
  connection pool, very useful for use in shiny applications and\_web services. DBI
  allows interaction with any of these sources using a\_consistent interface. We will
  discuss the most effective ways to use these packages in a data\_analysis, shiny
  applications and production web services. Talk 2: Tim Hoolihan: Explore R With Probability
  Exploring various aspects of R, while looking at a simple probability question with
  a poisson distribution.  "

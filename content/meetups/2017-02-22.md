title: Network Modeling of Materials Degradation...
description: "Nicholas Wheeler: Network Modeling of Materials Degradation: Network
  Structural Equation Modeling (netSEM) Analysis of Photovoltaic Modules under Damp
  Heat Exposure This research features network-SEM analysis, a domain knowledge informed
  approach to the causal modeling of physical systems, utilized to investigate a controlled
  laboratory study of photovoltaic (PV) modules degraded by damp heat (85C, 85% relative
  humidity) exposure testing. The PV modules, of two construction geometry types,
  were degraded by heat and moisture for over 3000 hours of total exposure dose, and\_coincidentally
  measured at 7 points in time over the course of the exposure by three distinctly
  different measurement techniques. Unique multidimensional digital outputs were produced
  by each measurement technique, each of which was interpreted by domain knowledge
  and computationally analyzed to describe each measurement as a collection of continuous
  numeric parameters, enabling data integration of the disparate collected data types
  into a cohesive system perspective. The resulting data set contains a wealth of
  information about the degradation of PV modules, and network-SEM analysis is applied
  to connect incident stressors to the mechanistic physical and chemical degradation
  pathways which ultimately lead to overall system electrical performance loss. Talk
  contains R-related content: -\_Importing and working with diverse file types containing
  raw data (.spc, .xml, .jpg) -\_Integrating multiple data types into a single cohesive
  analysis (chemical spectra,\_image data, and\_voltage-current curves) - Building
  an R package to perform the 'Network Structural Equation Modeling' statistical methodology
  - Linking sequential computational analytics steps into a pipeline from raw data
  through to final results "

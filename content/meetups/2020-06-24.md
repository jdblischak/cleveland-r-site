title: Environmental Impact of NLP with AmberMcKenzie
description: "Amber \u201CDoc Am\u201D McKenzie is a manager of emerging technologies
  at PwC. With a masters degree in linguistics and a Ph.D. in computer science, she
  has over 10 years experience in data science and natural language processing (NLP).
  Her professional interests include NLP, machine learning, predictive modeling, and
  computer learning. When she does get a spare moment outside of work, she enjoys
  reading, board games, dabbling with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis, and lifting weights.
  Ever wonder about the environmental impact of all the machine learning and simulation
  modeling you're doing? No? You're not alone. This is an area that hasn't really
  been talked about in the computer science and data science communities. But that
  doesn't mean it isn't a problem. This talk will introduce people to what it means
  to the environment to train big language models, mine bitcoin and do other computationally-expensive
  operations that have become commonplace in the race to develop better AI. The goal
  is to bring better awareness so that when possible, better choices can be made that
  respect environmental impact. "

title: 'Topics: Project Organization: Head-Ache to GNU Make; Data Exploration Exercise'
description: 'Alec Wong will be talking about project organization. Project file organization
  is a facet of research and analysis that is often overlooked and less often taught
  in science or business. Nevertheless good project organization has some significant
  implications for reproducibility, data/analytical integrity, and efficiency. This
  presentation will review file structures of my own R projects over time, and how
  I arrived at the current iteration, making use of Rstudio projects, Git, and most
  recently GNU Make. We are also going to try something new, a bit of a group exercise.
  Jim Hester and Tim Hoolihan (group organizers) will go through a data set exploration
  with input from the room. The goal is to think about how you approach a new data
  set, and compare suggested techniques for doing so. Nothing will be pre-coded, just
  a live coding group exercise. '

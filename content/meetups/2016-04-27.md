title: 'April Meeting: XGBoost and other Machine Learning Topics'
description: "PLEASE NOTE: We will be in the basement of the Level Seven building.
  There is a conference room down there. Sorry for the late change. Go in the main
  entrance and take the elevator down to B. Or enter through the back door, which
  goes directly into the basement. Following up on the linear algebra foundations,
  I'm going to walk through some machine learning projects I've done, and some packages
  I've been experimenting with.\_ If anyone has additional shorter topics they'd like
  to cover, please contact me. Tim "

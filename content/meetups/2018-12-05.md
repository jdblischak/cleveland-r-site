description: 'Have you ever been excited to try a new software package only to endup
  frustrated after spending hours getting it to install correctly?How often do you
  return to a project from a few months ago and thecode is broken due to software
  updates? Do you and your collaboratorsstruggle to run each others'' code on your
  own computers? Is yourGitHub Issue tracker full from users unable to install your
  softwareon operating systems that you are unfamiliar with? Do you ever wishyou could
  test out the latest version of a software package withoutaffecting your current
  setup? If you''ve ever faced any of thesechallenges, there is a better way to install
  and manage scientificsoftware across your various projects. Conda (https://conda.io/docs/)is
  a cross-platform, language-agnostic package management system andenvironment management
  system. And it''s not just for Python packages!Conda can also manage R packages
  and many other dependencies you mightneed for your data science projects. I will
  cover how conda comparesto other package and environment management systems, how
  to setupconda and install packages, how to create isolated computationalenvironments
  for individual projects, and how to build and share yourown conda packages. '

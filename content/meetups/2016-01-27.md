title: 'January: Clinical Essay Validation, Linear Algebra'
description: "Clinton will be speaking on the clinical essay validation. In addition,
  I will be doing a shorter talk summarizing handling linear algebra tasks in R. We'll
  be meeting at John Carroll this time, Dolan Science Center Room E244. Visitors should
  enter at the \"Carroll Gate\" on the Warrensville Center Road side of campus. They
  can tell the guard that they are here for the Greater Cleveland R Group meeting.
  Dolan Center is the big building that you face as you enter the gate. The room has
  a desktop and a projection system. Laptops can be connected, too. Here is a link
  to a map:\_http://webmedia.jcu.edu/campus-...\xAD. "

title: 'Jim Hester: Glue Package; Bryan Lewis: Correlation Regularization For Stocks'
description: "Bryan Lewis will discuss the correlation regularization problem for
  stocks. Jim Hester will talk on the glue package: String interpolation, evaluating
  a variable name to a value within a string, isa feature of many programming languages
  including Python, Julia, Javascript,Rust, and most Unix Shells. R\u2019s sprintf()
  and paste() functions providesome of this functionality, but have limitations which
  make them cumbersome touse. There are also some existing add on packages with similar
  functionality,however each has drawbacks. The glue package http://glue.tidyverse.org/
  performs robust stringinterpolation for R. This includes evaluation of variables
  and arbitrary R code,with a clean and simple syntax. Because it is dependency-free,
  it is easy toincorporate into packages. In addition, glue provides an extensible
  interfaceto perform more complex transformations; such as glue_sql() to constructSQL
  queries with automatically quoted variables. This talk will show how to utilize
  glue to write beautiful code which iseasy to read, write and maintain. We will also
  discuss ways to best use glue whenperformance is a concern. Finally we will create
  custom glue functions tailoredtowards specific use cases, such as JSON construction,
  colored messages, emojiinterpolation and more. "

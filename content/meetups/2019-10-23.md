title: Teaching Lab R&amp;D Chemists using RMD and Shiny with Mukul Mehta
description: 'Lab R&amp;D Chemists in Chemical, Food, Plastic, Polymer and Pharma
  industries are very creative and constantly develop new products over time. Their
  R&amp;D Managers worry, that R&amp;D is very slow and struggle to speed up NPD.
  Many big companies like DuPont, Dow, BF Goodrich Chemical and others have tried
  to bring new statistical and mathematical methods in-house, but without much success.
  Mukul Mehta will examine several problems he has identified and an R/Shiny based
  solution that he is developing to address these problems. Mukul hopes to train 10,000
  Lab R&amp;D chemists over three years. '

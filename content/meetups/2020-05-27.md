title: Rami Krispin on Covid19 Data Project
description: 'Rami''s Abstract: The goal of the Covid19R project is to create a uniform
  and tidy data format and set standards for Covid19 data in R. This enables the users
  to load to R seamlessly a clean, ready to use, and up-to-date covid19 dataset. The
  project currently includes several datasets such as covid19france, covid19nytimes,
  covid19swiss. In this talk, I will focus on approaches for building supporting tools
  in R for Covid19 data with the use of APIs, continuous integration with Github Actions,
  dashboards, visualization. More details about the project are available here: https://github.com/Covid19R
  Bio: Rami Krispin is a data scientist who mainly focuses on time series analysis
  and forecasting applications. He is the author of "Hands-On Time Series Analysis
  with R", and several R packages, including the TSstudio package for time series
  analysis and forecasting applications. Since the beginning of the covid19 outbreak,
  he wrote R dataset packages and created dashboards for tracking the outbreak (such
  as coronavirus, covid19italy, etc.) '

title: High-Performance Computing in R
description: "The meeting will take place on the\_7th floor in a room provided by
  Level7. \_ R is an incredibly rich and powerful language for exploratory data analysis
  and\_scientific computing. But, often mistakenly, R is not considered a good\_language
  for high-performance computing. In fact the language provides a\_remarkably comprehensive
  set of tools for high-performance computation.\_We'll discuss tips and tricks for
  writing R code for high-performance\_computation, including:\_ - Using fast low-level
  numeric libraries\_- Writing vectorized code\_- Working with data larger than memory\_-
  Parallel processing with 'parallel,' 'foreach,' and others\_- Using the right algorithms
  We'll focus on practical computation and show examples of fast large-scale\_principal
  components and generalized linear models among others. Feel free\_to come with questions
  about performance!\_ Bryan Lewis has worked with R for many years and is the author
  of several R packages\_including irlba, rredis, doRedis, websockets, bigalgebra,
  scidb, and others.\_He is the chief data scientist at Paradigm4 in Waltham, MA and
  has a Ph.D. in applied mathematics. \_ "

description: "Note the change of venue, we are at Kent State University's Math &amp;
  Science Building.\_ Our guest speaker is John C. Nash, a professor at the Telfer
  School of Management at the University of Ottawa.\_\_ Note: There will NOT be food
  served this time, as we are meeting a little later.\_ Gary Deinert of our group
  offered these tips for navigation: \"Tim, folks can get directions to the Kent State
  meeting at the Math building from https://www.kent.edu/cs/directions-our-departmen...\xAD.
  Google Maps address is 1315 E Summit Street, Kent, OH. I am currently teaching at
  KSU and can offer that Ted Boyd Drive has been under construction recently so people
  can continue on Campus Center Drive then turn RIGHT when it meets Summit farther
  down.\" "

title: '2 Talks: Michael Kane on fc package and Kyle Burkett on R at Progressive'
description: 'NOTE the change to 5/2 Talk 1:Generalized function composition and pipe
  construction with the fc package* The "pipe" operator is a convenient way to define
  sequences of functions. Implementations like magrittr''s %&amp;gt;% work by modifying
  unevaluated expressions to create functions that are called serially using the convention
  that intermediate values are stored as a variable named "." This approach results
  in "pipelines" that may be easier to read (but are often slower) when compared to
  "unpiped" alternatives. In this talk, I''ll show an alternative pipe implementation
  that does not rely on non-standard evaluation. Pipeline construction with this new
  package is slightly less compact than tidyverse equivalents but often yields more
  performant functions whose definitions are easy to read. Michael Kane is an Assistant
  Professor in Yale University''s Biostatistics Department. His research interests
  are in the areas of scalable statistical/machine learning, statistical computing,
  and early-phase clinical trials. Talk 2:How do you deploy and manage R at a fortune
  200 company? Do you use Windows or Linux? What version? What packages? What difficulties
  do you face and how do you make RAM available with large datasets? Join us as Kyle
  Burkett, IT Systems Analyst Lead, talks a bit about his experiences as the owner
  and maintainer of all things ''R'' at Progressive Insurance. '

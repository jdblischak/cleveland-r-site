title: A few interesting databases and R
description: 'SciDB is an open source database that organizes data in n-dimensional
  arrays. Interesting SciDB features include parallel processing, distributed storage,
  ACID transactions, and parallel time series and linear algebra operations. SciDB
  powers a number of big data projects including the NIH 1000 genomes browser. http://scidb.org.
  Redis is an open source, fast networked key/value database that supports interesting
  structured values like hash tables, queues, sorted sets and more. Redis is incredibly
  versatile and popular. http://redis.io. Dplyr extends the highly regarded split/apply/combine
  idea of plyr to data frames and related objects in external databases. Bryan Lewis
  is the maintainer of the scidb and rredis packages, and is starting to work on integration
  between SciDB and dplyr. He''ll show examples of all three projects. Bryan is a
  mathematician and chief data scientist for SciDB. '
